  "about.path.title": "My Path",
  "about.path.p1": "My journey wasn’t linear. It began between music and code, film sets and curiosity. Studies in marketing and informatics laid a foundation, but it was my time in product management (CODE University) that connected the dots – between structure, empathy, and purpose.",
  "about.path.p2": "Over the years, I’ve moved through different roles – as a developer, product thinker, and collaborator in both digital and cultural spaces. I worked with startups like YPTOKEY and Data4Life, co-founded U/skillity – a platform for shared knowledge – and Kultstätte Keller, a space for art, sound, and community. Along the way, I also supported various film productions – often in assistant roles behind the scenes. These experiences, though practical and grounded, shaped how I understand collaboration, pace, and presence.",
